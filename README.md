# Lab 5: Map Description
For figuring out my basemap style, I liked the colors for from lecture 11, but wanted to add some other custom features that would be best used in a specific area.  So I then determined that the center of my base map would be the Linville Gorge.  The Linville Gorge is known for steep terrain and great climbing, so I decided to highlight those characteristics of the terrain by adding topographic lines contoured by Feet, and then I also added cliff lines at a closer zoom level to the map.  Therefore, this map gives a basic introduction to the type of terrain that the Linville Gorge offers as well as the locations of cliffs in the gorge.
